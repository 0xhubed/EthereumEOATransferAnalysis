## Advanced Analytics

- ✅ **Transaction Pattern Recognition**: Identify common transaction patterns and behaviors
- ✅ **Smart Contract Interaction Analysis**: Show how addresses interact with smart contracts
- ✅ **Wallet Profiling**: Categorize wallets based on behavior (e.g., trader, hodler, DeFi user)
- ✅ **Risk Scoring**: Assign risk scores to addresses based on transaction patterns
- **Identity Clustering**: Group addresses that likely belong to the same entity
- ✅ **Gas Usage Analysis**: Visualize gas spending patterns and efficiency

## User Experience Improvements
